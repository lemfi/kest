= Steps

A step is where interaction with your system happen, it:

* has a name
* can be retried
* has an execution
* has a list of assertions

[source,kotlin]
----
step(
    name = "a name a step has",
    retry = 10.times `by intervals of` 200.ms, // if assertions of step fail, step will be retried 10 times by intervals of 200 ms before really failing. Useful if you have asynchonous stuff going on on your backends.
) {
    // here goes the definition of the execution
} `assert that` {
    // here goes list of assertions
}
